## Enable pg_stat_statements for Query Analysis

pg_stat_statements tracks execution statistics for all queries, helping identify slow and frequent queries.

**Incorrect (no visibility into query patterns):**

```sql
-- Database is slow, but which queries are the problem?
-- No way to know without pg_stat_statements
```

**Correct (enable and query pg_stat_statements):**

```sql
-- Enable the extension
create extension if not exists pg_stat_statements;

-- Find slowest queries by total time
select
  calls,
  round(total_exec_time::numeric, 2) as total_time_ms,
  round(mean_exec_time::numeric, 2) as mean_time_ms,
  query
from pg_stat_statements
order by total_exec_time desc
limit 10;

-- Find most frequent queries
select calls, query
from pg_stat_statements
order by calls desc
limit 10;

-- Reset statistics after optimization
select pg_stat_statements_reset();
```

Key metrics to monitor:

```sql
-- Queries with high mean time (candidates for optimization)
select query, mean_exec_time, calls
from pg_stat_statements
where mean_exec_time > 100  -- > 100ms average
order by mean_exec_time desc;
```

## UI & presentation (Supabase Design System v2)

When this Postgres/Supabase work surfaces in product UI—Studio-style tables, SQL editor, metrics, or dashboards—use **[design-v2.md](../../ui-craft/references/design-v2.md)** as the canonical design reference: CSS variables and tokens; typography (JetBrains Mono for UUIDs, numerics, SQL); data tables (NULL and UUID styling per §3.3 and §8.7); SQL syntax palette (§10); charts, toasts, modals; dark-first layout; motion and icons (§16–§17). Accessibility: §7 (focus rings, contrast). Prefer CSS variables (`--brand`, `--foreground-*`) over raw hex in components.
