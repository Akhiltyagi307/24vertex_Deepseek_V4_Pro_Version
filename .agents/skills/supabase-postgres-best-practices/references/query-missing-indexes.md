## Add Indexes on WHERE and JOIN Columns

Queries filtering or joining on unindexed columns cause full table scans, which become exponentially slower as tables grow.

**Incorrect (sequential scan on large table):**

```sql
-- No index on customer_id causes full table scan
select * from orders where customer_id = 123;

-- EXPLAIN shows: Seq Scan on orders (cost=0.00..25000.00 rows=100 width=85)
```

**Correct (index scan):**

```sql
-- Create index on frequently filtered column
create index orders_customer_id_idx on orders (customer_id);

select * from orders where customer_id = 123;

-- EXPLAIN shows: Index Scan using orders_customer_id_idx (cost=0.42..8.44 rows=100 width=85)
```

For JOIN columns, always index the foreign key side:

```sql
-- Index the referencing column
create index orders_customer_id_idx on orders (customer_id);

select c.name, o.total
from customers c
join orders o on o.customer_id = c.id;
```

## UI & presentation (Supabase Design System v2)

When this Postgres/Supabase work surfaces in product UI—Studio-style tables, SQL editor, metrics, or dashboards—use **[design-v2.md](../../ui-craft/references/design-v2.md)** as the canonical design reference: CSS variables and tokens; typography (JetBrains Mono for UUIDs, numerics, SQL); data tables (NULL and UUID styling per §3.3 and §8.7); SQL syntax palette (§10); charts, toasts, modals; dark-first layout; motion and icons (§16–§17). Accessibility: §7 (focus rings, contrast). Prefer CSS variables (`--brand`, `--foreground-*`) over raw hex in components.
