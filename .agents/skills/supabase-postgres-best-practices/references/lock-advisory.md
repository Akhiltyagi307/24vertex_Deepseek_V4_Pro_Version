## Use Advisory Locks for Application-Level Locking

Advisory locks provide application-level coordination without requiring database rows to lock.

**Incorrect (creating rows just for locking):**

```sql
-- Creating dummy rows to lock on
create table resource_locks (
  resource_name text primary key
);

insert into resource_locks values ('report_generator');

-- Lock by selecting the row
select * from resource_locks where resource_name = 'report_generator' for update;
```

**Correct (advisory locks):**

```sql
-- Session-level advisory lock (released on disconnect or unlock)
select pg_advisory_lock(hashtext('report_generator'));
-- ... do exclusive work ...
select pg_advisory_unlock(hashtext('report_generator'));

-- Transaction-level lock (released on commit/rollback)
begin;
select pg_advisory_xact_lock(hashtext('daily_report'));
-- ... do work ...
commit;  -- Lock automatically released
```

Try-lock for non-blocking operations:

```sql
-- Returns immediately with true/false instead of waiting
select pg_try_advisory_lock(hashtext('resource_name'));

-- Use in application
if (acquired) {
  -- Do work
  select pg_advisory_unlock(hashtext('resource_name'));
} else {
  -- Skip or retry later
}
```

## UI & presentation (Supabase Design System v2)

When this Postgres/Supabase work surfaces in product UI—Studio-style tables, SQL editor, metrics, or dashboards—use **[design-v2.md](../../ui-craft/references/design-v2.md)** as the canonical design reference: CSS variables and tokens; typography (JetBrains Mono for UUIDs, numerics, SQL); data tables (NULL and UUID styling per §3.3 and §8.7); SQL syntax palette (§10); charts, toasts, modals; dark-first layout; motion and icons (§16–§17). Accessibility: §7 (focus rings, contrast). Prefer CSS variables (`--brand`, `--foreground-*`) over raw hex in components.
